{"name":"Renewable Energy: A quick overview","tagline":"Energy and Future","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nRenewable energy is a very good, reliable way of generating electricity without creating almost any pollution. \r\n\r\n## There are several major types of renewable energy sources:\r\n\r\n * [Hydro](#hydro)\r\n * [Wind](#wind)\r\n * [Solar](#solar)\r\n * [Geothermal](#geothermal)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe relative use of each type looks like this:\r\n\r\n![](pics/pieChart.png)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Hydro\r\n\r\nHydroelectric energy is a type of energy derived from the kinetic motion of water because of gravity. It accounts for around 81% of power generation of renewable energy, and it accounts for 16.3% of all electricity globally. Hydro electric power produced about 3503 Twh of electricity in 2014. Which provides power for about 380,000,000 homes.\r\n\r\n|A hydroelectric power plant|\r\n|------------|\r\n|[![](pics/damb.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Dam_(2890371280).jpg)|\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Wind\r\n\r\nWind power is a type of energy that works by generating energy from the wind. It accounts for about 13% of all electricity generated in renewable energy, and for about 2.82% of all energy generated globally. It generated about 550 TWh in 2014. It provides power for about 60,000,000 homes.\r\n\r\n|A wind farm|\r\n|------------|\r\n|[![](pics/turbine.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Fentonwindpark1.jpg)|\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Solar\r\n\r\nSolar energy works by generating energy from the sun. It accounts for about 4% of energy produced of renewable energy, and for about 1.08% of all electricity generated globally. It generated about 189.5 TWh in 2014. It provides power for about 20,500,000 homes.\r\n\r\n|A solar farm|\r\n|------------|\r\n|[![](pics/solar.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mount_Komekura_Photovoltaic_power_plant_Jan2012.JPG)|\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Comparison\r\n\r\n|    Type     | Power generates in Terawatt hours |\r\n|-------------|-----------------------------------|\r\n|Hydroelectric| 3503|\r\n\r\n## Geothermal\r\n\r\nGeothermal energy is a type of energy that is derived from heat inside the earth. It accounts for 2% of power generation of renewable energy, and it accounts for 0.54% of all the global energy generated. It generated about 79.7 TWh of electricity in 2014. It provides power for about 8,500,000 homes.\r\n\r\n|A geothermal power plant|\r\n|------------|\r\n|[![](pics/gtherm.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Krafla_geothermal_power_station_wiki.jpg)|\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n#### Sources\r\n```\r\nThe following sources of information was used in creating this website:\r\n- wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy\r\n\r\nLinks to images used\r\n- hydro https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Krafla_geothermal_power_station_wiki.jpg\r\n- wind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Fentonwindpark1.jpg\r\n-  solar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Mount_Komekura_Photovoltaic_power_plant_Jan2012.JPG\r\n- geothermal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Krafla_geothermal_power_station_wiki.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
